[![Model the Empire](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Rq3JjUUgTBI/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Rq3JjUUgTBI?si=8CelrIZQy092suII&t=924 "Modeling the Star Wars Empire")


## Project Overview
Welcome to the Star Wars Empire Ontology Project! **Set in the captivating universe of Star Wars just before the events of "Return of the Jedi"**, our ambitious goal is to create a comprehensive synthetic dataset that embodies the entire Galactic Empire. This includes detailed chains of command, lists of ship, troop, and droid movements, communications across different cities and planets, dynamic logistics and supply routes, mission objectives, and priority targets for Jedi encounters. Our ultimate objective is to build out the Empire's complete ontology and enable interactive exploration and analysis through Palantir Foundry/AIP.

## Project Goals
- **Synthetic Process Logs**: Generate synthetic process logs for the Empire and import into Foundry Machinery.
- **Building the Empire's Ontology**: Construct a detailed and dynamic representation of the Galactic Empire's operational structure and activities.
- **Dynamic Data Generation**: Create synthetic data that reflects the complexity and scale of the Empire's operations.
- **Palantir Foundry/AIP Integration**: Facilitate data interaction and visualization through Palantir Foundry/AIP to enable advanced analytics and insights.

## Help Wanted
This project is a massive undertaking and requires the collective expertise of numerous specialists. We are actively seeking contributions from:

### Data Generation Specialists
- **Role**: Develop robust Python scripts to generate realistic and scalable synthetic data that represent various aspects of the Empire. These scripts typically genearte SAP event logs that are importable using [Foundry Machinery](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/process-mining/core-concepts/). View a sample [here](./ProcessLogGenerator.py).
- **Skills**: Proficiency in Python, creativity in data generation, understanding of Star Wars lore.

### Palantir Foundry Engineers
- **Role**: Integrate the synthetic data into Palantir Foundry, design the Ontology, building required FoOs, building AIP Agents, and packaging the solution using Marketplace.
- **Skills**: Experience with Palantir Foundry, building FoOs, data transforms, Ontology creation, and Model Adapters.

### Supply Chain and Logistics Experts
- **Role**: Provide insights into creating realistic supply chain and logistics data, including troop movements, resource allocation, and supply routes.
- **Skills**: Knowledge in supply chain management, logistics planning, and large-scale operational coordination.

### Data Modelers and Engineers
- **Role**: Design and implement data models that effectively capture the complexity of the Empire's operations and interactions.
- **Skills**: Expertise in data modeling, database design, and data engineering principles.

### Star Wars Enthusiasts and Historians
- **Role**: Ensure the accuracy and authenticity of the data in relation to Star Wars lore and history.
- **Skills**: In-depth knowledge of the Star Wars universe, attention to detail, and a passion for the franchise.
